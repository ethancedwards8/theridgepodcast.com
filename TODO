consider rendering /podcast with youtube (for those that apply)?
include categories!

/speaker/
add some sort of speaker db?

maybe have audio files available under /podcast-download/

xml/rss podcast feed:
https://theridgepodcast.com/feed/podcast
https://theridgepodcast.com/feed/podcast/the-ridge-podcast/

write a script to add an episode: take in title, speakers, audio file to upload to cloudflare, tags...

figure out scheduling. maybe just an at command with docker refresh? not sure...!
