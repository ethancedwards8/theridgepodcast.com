This episode is unique. Instead of the usual book talk or interview, Ethan discusses his involvement as a volunteer Poll Worker/Election Officer in the June 17th Primary in Carroll County, Virginia. He discusses the training process, the proceedings on election day, the results of the elections, and provides some thoughts on the benefits of volunteering and civic engagement. 



Ethan wanted to send his congratulations to each and every candidate who ran, regardless of the results. He also wanted to give a special thanks to everyone who has been on the podcast and shown their support; it would not be possible without them. Thank you all.
