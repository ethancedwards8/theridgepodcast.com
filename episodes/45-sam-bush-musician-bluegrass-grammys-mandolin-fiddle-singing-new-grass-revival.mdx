In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Mr. Sam Bush, an award winning musician that specializes in Bluegrass, or "New Grass". He was a member of the New Grass Revival band for several years and is now a part of the Sam Bush band. He is particularly known for his work involving the mandolin. They discuss his early life, taking band classes in high school, influences on his music style, and the start of his musical career. Later, they talk about his Grammy wins, nominations, and talks about the future of Bluegrass. This was an informative conversation for both Ethan and Luke.
