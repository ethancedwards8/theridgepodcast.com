In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Mrs. Shannon Dalton, educator, coach, parent, and philanthropist. She discusses her time at Randolph-Macon Woman's College, working in radio, journalism, and her high school experience. She talks about her experiences teaching in Richmond and contrasts it to teaching at CCHS. After, they discuss various notable pieces of literature, focusing specifically on Our Town by Thornton Wilder. They then discuss Mrs. Dalton's involvement in Rotary, Lion's Club, and various volunteering efforts she organizes. This episode was very special for Luke and Ethan as they both had her as a teacher in 11th grade and are close with her outside the classroom.



Thank you again Mrs. Dalton for being on the podcast.
