In this episode, Jeffrey (Luke) Watson and Ethan Edwards interview Delegate Wren Williams (VA, HD-9). They ask about how he got into politics just a few years ago, his time and accomplishments serving as a state representative in Virginia, and his personal life as a new father, husband, and owner of a small business, a local law firm.



Thank you again Delegate Williams for being on the podcast.
