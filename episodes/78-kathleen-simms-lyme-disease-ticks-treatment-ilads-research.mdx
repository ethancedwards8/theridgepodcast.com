In this episode, Ethan interviews Mrs. Kathleen Simms, local expert on Lyme and associated Tick-borne diseases. They discuss her son's story with the disease, their struggle to find treatment, and the long term impacts of untreated Lyme. Then, they new research on the proper treatment of short term and chronic Lyme, vaccines, local practitioners knowledgeable about the diseases, and more. Mrs. Simms also gives background into how the disease works inside the body, resources to learn more, and her contact information. Ethan and Mrs. Simms hope to raise more awareness about treatment, prevention, and general knowledge.
