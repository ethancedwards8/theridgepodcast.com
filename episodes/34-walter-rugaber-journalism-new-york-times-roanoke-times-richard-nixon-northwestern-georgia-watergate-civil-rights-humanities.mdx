In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Mr. Walter Rugaber. Mr. Rugaber is a former journalist, president and publisher of the Roanoke Times, New York Times correspondent, Interim President of Hollins University, and member of the Virginia Humanities board. They discuss his life growing up, his decision to go to Northwestern University for journalism, his experience and their unique program, and his first job. They then switch to the Civil Rights and his experiences meeting influential figures like Martin Luther King Jr. After that, they discuss Richard Nixon, the New York Times, and the Watergate scandal and his role in uncovering it. They then change gears into his time at the Roanoke Times and the learning curve when it came to publishing a newspaper versus only writing it. This is a wonderful interview, be sure to check it out.



Thank you again Mr. Rugaber for being on the podcast.
