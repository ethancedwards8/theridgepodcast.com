<p>In this episode, Ethan interviews Mrs. Sara June, local podcaster, author, and journalist. During, they discuss the similarities between the Farm Crisis and offshoring of manufacturing jobs, the rising opioid crisis in rural communities, and the twin county's Recovery Court program efforts to help heal the community. From there, they discuss Mrs. June's book "I Have Walked One Mile After Dark in a Hard Rain" and its intriguing history, her research process, and her motivation for starting her own newsroom "The Neighborly".</p>
