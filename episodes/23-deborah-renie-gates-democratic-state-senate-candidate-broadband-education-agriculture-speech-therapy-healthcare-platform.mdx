In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Deborah "Renie" Gates. Renie is the Democratic State Senate candidate for District 7. They also interviewed her mom a few weeks ago. She and her mom are running together as a mother-daughter campaign, the first mother-daughter political pair in the country's history. They are based in Floyd, Virginia and have been located in this area for the past 40+ years. They discuss Speech Therapy, Agriculture, Healthcare, Broadband, and other important but difficult topics.



Thank you again Mrs. Gates for being on the podcast.
