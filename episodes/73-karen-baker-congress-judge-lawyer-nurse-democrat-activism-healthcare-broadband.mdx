<p>In this episode, Ethan interviews Mrs. Karen Baker, Democratic Candidate for the House of Representatives (HD-9). They discuss her education, experience as a trial lawyer for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Administrative Law Judge, and Registered Nurse. She recounts stories from her time as a lawyer, her decision to step into a judgeship, and her path to switching careers and becoming a nurse. They then discuss her goals in Congress, her nuanced perspective on the overruling of <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, her focus on rural healthcare, broadband, and and emphasis on local issues instead of foreign policy. A proud advocate of Southwest Virginia and self-proclaimed "rural Democrat", Mrs. Baker wants to fix local problems and serve her district instead of exclusively focusing on national politics.</p>
