In this episode, Ethan interviews Mrs. Karen Baker, Democratic Candidate for the House of Representatives (HD-9). They discuss her education, experience as a trial lawyer for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Administrative Law Judge, and Registered Nurse. She recounts stories from her time as a lawyer, her decision to step into a judgeship, and her path to switching careers and becoming a nurse. They then discuss her goals in Congress, her nuanced perspective on the overruling of <em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em>, her focus on rural healthcare, broadband, and and emphasis on local issues instead of foreign policy. A proud advocate of Southwest Virginia and self-proclaimed "rural Democrat", Mrs. Baker wants to fix local problems and serve her district instead of exclusively focusing on national politics.



Thank you again Mrs. Baker for being on the podcast.
