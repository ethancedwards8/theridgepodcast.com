In this episode, Ethan and Luke discuss The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli. This book is interesting and very controversial. The book's thesis is how a monarch should rule a country. It presents a framework for taking, executing, and maintaining control. Being required reading for many Political Science, Government, and Philosophy programs, Ethan and Luke decided to read the book and give their thoughts on it. They also discuss the role of translations when it comes to reading historical books such as The Prince. Thanks for listening.
