In this episode Ethan and Luke discuss Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck. It is a classic that many have heard of but have not actually read. It is a small and digestible book, but it is nevertheless very impactful and thought provoking. This is a great book for anyone looking for a shorter but very intense and pensive read.
