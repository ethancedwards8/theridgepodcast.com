In this episode, Ethan interviews Mr. Jared Heath, USMC veteran and owner of AlthaTechnology. A Maine native, he joined the Marine Corps as an Infantryman and served two tours in Iraq. After re-upping, he switched to being an Marine Security Guard, or an Embassy Guard. There, he recounts stories from being in Finland, Cuba, and an invasion in Syria. After leaving the military, he began his journey to start AlthaTechnology. They also discuss his fitness journey, including his recent 28 mile run and his upcoming marathon. Finally, they discuss the importance of faith, his advice for younger generations, and the meaning of life.
