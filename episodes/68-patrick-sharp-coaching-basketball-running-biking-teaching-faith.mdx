In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Coach Patrick Sharp, former teacher and coach at Carroll County High School. They cover his time playing college basketball, and his decision to get a job as a teacher. He discusses his time as a Basketball, Track, and Cross Country coach and then explains his coaching methodology. They then discuss his involvement in church, the Bible, and his faith. This was a very special episode for both Ethan and Luke as they were both coached by him for Cross Country in middle school. 



Thank you again Coach Sharp for being on the podcast.
