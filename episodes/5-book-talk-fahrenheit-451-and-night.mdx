In this episode, Luke and Ethan discuss two books: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and Night by Elie Wiesel. They talk about interesting themes in each book, how Fahrenheit draws many scary parallels to the world we live in today, and talk about how meaningful the story that is told in Night is to them. Near the end of the episode, they talk about some future plans for the podcast and contemplate on what episode format is better.
