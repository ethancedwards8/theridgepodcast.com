In this episode, Ethan and Luke discuss a niche but rich topic, the $2 Bill. They discuss everything from the history of the bill, it's use, prevalent myths and superstitions that are commonly held, and even meaningful stories that involve the bill. While discussing these topics, they often cite and reference a documentary and book, both of which were created by John Bennardo. They also hope to interview Mr. Bennardo in the coming weeks to do an exclusive episode on the deuce with him.
