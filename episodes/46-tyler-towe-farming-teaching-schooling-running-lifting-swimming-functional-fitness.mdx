In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Mr. Tyler Towe, a lifeguard, substitute teacher, and student. Mr. Towe is the youngest guest they have had on the show and therefore offers a unique perspective on many of their questions. They discuss his early life, farming, various jobs including being an AmeriCorps tutor and mail carrier for the post office. They discuss his shift in educational perspective, from high school, then to Wytheville Community College, and finally to Liberty University where he is completing his Bachelor's in Social Study Education. He is currently a full time substitute teacher, taking lifeguarding shifts at the Carroll Wellness Center, and maintaining his physical health through running and lifting all while being enrolled as a college student. Later in the interview they discuss running, swimming, lifting, and the health benefits of functional fitness. 



Thank you again Mr. Towe for being on the podcast.
