In this episode, Ethan and Luke interview Mr. Seth Greer, Navy veteran, coach, former law enforcement, and educator. During the interview, Mr. Greer describes his time in the Navy as a Master-at-arms, including some of the challenges he faced. He then delineates his career in law enforcement, narrating his experiences working his way up the ladder, and eventually joining the drug task force team. After his career in law enforcement, he became a teacher through a career-switcher program after a suggestion from Dr. Burnette. He discusses his introduction to teaching, and then transitioning to coaching. From there, his career in Football and Strength and Conditioning blossomed. Throughout the episode, they discuss weight lifting, nutrition, sleep, and hydration. This was a wonderful episode. 



Thank you again Mr. Greer for being on the podcast.
